# [Soundbubble](https://takeonfaith.github.io/soundbubble/)

## Soundbubble is my project made with React.js and Firebase.

Basically, it's a music web application, that has a chat in it, karaoke mode, ability to share music, playlists and authors, and more

There were 4 main purposes while making this:
-1. To learn new stuff about React, Firebase and the way people usually make something like Spotify
-2. To make my own music service, because I like listening to music (and because it's always way cooler to use something you created yourself)
-3. To gain experience of coding more or less big applications
-4. I had several ideas (like karaoke mode or dynamic background color change depending on music/album/author image, for instance) I wanted to try to make by my own to find, whether I can do them at all
